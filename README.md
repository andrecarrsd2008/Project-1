# Project-One

This application was created for those who like to explore the outdoors. If you're someone who likes to travel 
with a group of friends and take on the sights and go backpacking or hike up a mountain side. This app allows for folks like you to type
in a specific city and find out where one can travel to get the best adventure out of their travel plans.

Our group used HTML/CSS to create the login page of our project. We also used an API from Yelp to get information regarding fun things
to do in cities across the United States. We also used Firebase to store the login information.
